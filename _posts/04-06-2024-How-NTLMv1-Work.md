## How NTLMv1 Work?

We are aware of detailed information and tools that might be used for attacks against NT LAN Manager version 1 (NTLMv1) and LAN Manager (LM) network authentication. Improvements in computer hardware and software algorithms have made these protocols vulnerable to published attacks for obtaining user credentials. The information and available toolsets specifically target environments that do not enforce NTLMv2 authentication. We strongly encourage customers to evaluate their environments and update network authentication settings. All supported Microsoft operating systems provide NTLMv2 authentication capabilities.
